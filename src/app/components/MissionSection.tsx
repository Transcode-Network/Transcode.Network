            We believe that technology should serve our communities, not exploit them. Our work centers 
            privacy, accessibility, and the lived experiences of trans people, especially those most 
            marginalized by systems of oppression.

            From mutual aid networks to privacy tools, from community platforms to resource databases â€” 
            we're building the digital infrastructure our communities need to thrive.
